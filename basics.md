# Overview

The general outline of this document will be:

1. Thinking like a programmer
2. Getting good at coding (not written out yet)
3. Getting an internship (not written out yet)

This document is intended for those who are just starting their computer science degree and have little to no prior exposure to the field.

# 1. Thinking like a Programmer

Programming requires a different thought process compared to conventional academic subjects like math and physics. Often, the most challenging aspect isn't memorizing syntax, but rather learning how to transform abstract requirements into programmable solutions using basic programming constructs.

Consider coding a rock-paper-scissors game. You would need to break this down into functional components such as:

- Getting user input (selecting rock, paper, or scissors)
- Generating the computer's choice
- Determining the winner of each round
- Tracking the score
- Determining the overall winner

After breaking down the game into these functional components, you need to:

1. Further decompose each component into actual code - for example, translating "get user input" into using the programming language's built-in input function and storing the result in a variable.
2. Ensure each component can integrate with others to create a cohesive whole.

Programming requires both micro-level problem solving (converting functional descriptions into code using proper syntax) and macro-level problem solving (breaking down program descriptions into smaller, manageable components).

The skill of breaking down complex problems isn't typically taught in high school. While you'll likely encounter moments of confusion and uncertainty, persistence and the right resources will help you develop this crucial skill.

Here are resources to help you think like a programmer:

[Introduction to Programming and Computer Science](https://youtu.be/zOjov-2OZ0E?si=Yg3uBIhIn6ls4OUI) (**required**)

- Covers programming fundamentals in a language-agnostic way
- Provides an excellent one-hour introduction to get started

[Intro to C++](https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI?si=Lz2oeG2X7pYBPfDB) (**required**)

- Throughout the course, the instructor creates several mini-projects like a number guessing game. To maximize your learning, try this approach: When he announces a new project, pause the video and attempt to build it yourself first. Give yourself about 30 minutes to genuinely try solving it. If you get stuck, that's completely normal - this is where real learning happens. Only after this genuine attempt should you watch his solution. This method helps you develop problem-solving skills and makes the instructor's solutions more meaningful since you'll understand exactly which parts you struggled with.
- When learning concepts (variables, loops, etc.), watch and follow along, then try recreating the code from memory without referencing the video

This "try it first" approach might feel challenging, but it's far more effective than passive watching. You'll develop a much stronger understanding of both the concepts and the problem-solving process this way.

- Excellent for reviewing C++ fundamentals
- Good self-assessment tool for language comprehension

## Recommended Time Management

Dedicating 30-60 minutes daily to supplementary learning materials alongside your coursework can significantly enhance your development. The required videos would take approximately two and a half weeks to complete at one hour per day. However, your primary focus should remain on your academic coursework.
