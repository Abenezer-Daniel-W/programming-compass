3. Getting an internship (not written out yet)

This document is intended for those who are just starting their computer science degree and have little to no prior exposure to the field.

# 1. Thinking like a Programmer

Programming requires a different thought process compared to conventional academic subjects like math and physics. Often, the most challenging aspect isn't memorizing syntax, but rather learning how to transform abstract requirements into programmable solutions using basic programming constructs.

Consider coding a rock-paper-scissors game. You would need to break this down into functional components such as:

- Getting user input (selecting rock, paper, or scissors)
- Generating the computer's choice
- Determining the winner of each round
- Tracking the score
- Determining the overall winner

After breaking down the game into these functional components, you need to:

1. Further decompose each component into actual code - for example, translating "get user input" into using the programming language's built-in input function and storing the result in a variable.
2. Ensure each component can integrate with others to create a cohesive whole.

Programming requires both micro-level problem solving (converting functional descriptions into code using proper syntax) and macro-level problem solving (breaking down program descriptions into smaller, manageable components).

The skill of breaking down complex problems isn't typically taught in high school. While you'll likely encounter moments of confusion and uncertainty, persistence and the right resources will help you develop this crucial skill.

Here are resources to help you think like a programmer:

[Introduction to Programming and Computer Science](https://youtu.be/zOjov-2OZ0E?si=Yg3uBIhIn6ls4OUI) (**required**)

- Covers programming fundamentals in a language-agnostic way
- Provides an excellent one-hour introduction to get started

[Intro to C++](https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI?si=Lz2oeG2X7pYBPfDB) (**required**)

- Throughout the course, the instructor creates several mini-projects like a number guessing game. To maximize your learning, try this approach: When he announces a new project, pause the video and attempt to build it yourself first. Give yourself about 30 minutes to genuinely try solving it. If you get stuck, that's completely normal - this is where real learning happens. Only after this genuine attempt should you watch his solution. This method helps you develop problem-solving skills and makes the instructor's solutions more meaningful since you'll understand exactly which parts you struggled with.
- When learning concepts (variables, loops, etc.), watch and follow along, then try recreating the code from memory without referencing the video

This "try it first" approach might feel challenging, but it's far more effective than passive watching. You'll develop a much stronger understanding of both the concepts and the problem-solving process this way.

[Learn-cpp](https://www.learn-cpp.org/) (**optional**)

- Excellent for reviewing C++ fundamentals
- Good self-assessment tool for language comprehension

## Recommended Time Management

Dedicating 30-60 minutes daily to supplementary learning materials alongside your coursework can significantly enhance your development. The required videos would take approximately two and a half weeks to complete at one hour per day. However, your primary focus should remain on your academic coursework.

# How to Get Good at Programming

Programming is more than just writing code—it’s about turning abstract ideas into concrete, working software. It’s like taking a vague sketch and transforming it into a detailed blueprint.

Imagine you need to build an app that manages employee work schedules—tracking who works when and preventing conflicts. To pull this off, you need two things:

- **Strong fundamentals** in programming.
- **Knowledge of tools and frameworks** that help you build your project faster.

## The Beginner's Journey

Let’s say you only know Python and have created a few simple terminal applications. Now, you’re ready to take on a web app project.

1. **Explore Your Options:**  
   You search online for “how to build a web application with Python” and discover frameworks like Flask, Django, and Streamlit. You might check out a blog from a reputable site like Real Python or watch an introductory Flask tutorial on YouTube.

2. **The Transition:**  
   This is where you move from a beginner who builds basic terminal apps to someone who can create real software. After one tutorial, it’s easy to feel the urge to watch more or read additional articles—especially if you’re scared of making mistakes. The fear of the unknown, uncertainty, and self-doubt can push you into a cycle of endless learning.

## Why More Tutorials Aren’t Always Better

Here’s the truth: real learning happens when you put your knowledge to the test. Think about it—watching six chemistry lectures won’t help you as much as watching one lecture and then solving problems on your own.

In programming, the exercise isn’t answering questions in a textbook; it’s building a prototype of your project. There’s even a term for beginners who watch endless tutorials without ever coding on their own: **tutorial hell**. And trust me, it’s a trap you want to avoid.

## The Best Way to Learn

I once watched a [great video](https://youtu.be/vFjXKOXdgGo?si=xc38z_RJUM8shZor) where a game developer explained that you only need to learn enough to start, then dive in and solve problems as they arise. Here’s a simple plan to follow:

- **Watch One Video or Read One Article:**  
  Get just enough background to understand the basics.

- **Start Building Your Project:**  
  Begin coding your app right away, even if it’s not perfect.

- **Google Your Problems:**  
  When you hit a roadblock—say, connecting your database to your Flask app—don’t go back to more tutorials. Instead, search for “how to connect Flask backend to database” and implement the solution you find.

Tutorials are just the starting point. They’re meant to give you a hint of what to search for when you’re stuck. True progress comes from tackling challenges head-on and learning by doing.

### A Note on AI

Avoid using AI while you're learning—it's a trap that can prevent deep understanding. Unless your livelihood depends on your output, resist the temptation. Relying too much on AI can make you a passive learner rather than an active problem solver.

## How to Become a Really Great Programmer

Assuming you've taken the advice above to heart, you'll likely learn more technologies and build plenty of side projects. But if you truly want to excel as a programmer, make sure you pay close attention in your core computer science classes. There's a reason these courses are considered essential—they provide the backbone for understanding complex software systems. When you're building something that needs to be efficient and reliable, you'll rely on these fundamentals.

In addition to mastering core CS topics like algorithms, operating systems, and networking, consider deepening your skills by:

- **Expanding Your Language Proficiency:**  
  Enhance your expertise with the language you currently use, or explore new technologies. For example, reading _Fluent Python_ can help you grasp all the syntax and features of Python.

- **Learning Software Design:**  
  Read books like _The Philosophy of Software Design_ to better understand how to structure large projects and develop maintainable programs.

By focusing on both the fundamentals and continuous learning, you'll significantly broaden the range of projects you can tackle and become a truly great programmer.

## What to Do When You’re Unsure About Projects

If you're not sure what project to build, don't worry—it’s a common challenge. Here are some ideas to kickstart your creativity:

### Build Something You Wish Existed

Think about a tool or service that would make life easier. For example, a friend in Seattle was frustrated that local community centers and shops relied on a shared bulletin board for advertising, renting rooms, and requesting help. So, he built an app to simplify the process.

### Recreate Software You Love

Try making a simplified version of an app you already enjoy using. Creating a basic Instagram or Reddit clone can teach you a lot about design, functionality, and user experience.

### Explore Online Resources

If you're still stuck, browse GitHub for repositories filled with project ideas. These collections can provide a wealth of inspiration.

### Jump into a Hackathon

Hackathons are a great way to spark creativity. With their strict time limits, they force you to build something quickly and focus on finishing a project—often leading to innovative solutions.

### Just Start Building!

Remember, the best ideas often emerge when you take action. Begin with a small project, learn from the process, and let your ideas evolve as you build.

Plus AI is good at generating project ideas.
